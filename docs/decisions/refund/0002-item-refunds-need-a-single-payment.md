# 0002 Items can be refunded only from a bill's only payment

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-09-29

## Context

Refunding chosen items needs to know which payment paid for which lines.
Only when one payment is claimed for a bill are all of the bill's lines its
own. With several payments, Payky cannot tell which payment paid which line.

## Decision

Staff can refund chosen items while no other payment of its bill has a
claim. Otherwise only an amount is offered. A tip is never part of an item
refund. Returning the rest of a line returns the rest of its amount, so
rounding leaves nothing behind.

## Alternatives considered

None recorded.

## Consequences

Bills paid by several payments are refunded by amount only, until payments
record which lines they paid. A claim whose transaction was deleted still
counts here, though the payment's status ignores it.
