# 0005 A refund of goods may return everything the payment received but its tip

Status: accepted
Date: 2026-10-01

## Context

A payment can receive more than its amount, through a second settlement or a
transfer larger than the payment. Its tip is refunded on its own (see
refund/0004).

## Decision

The limit of a refund by amount or by items is what the payment received:
the cash received for a cash payment with a received amount, its amount
otherwise, plus what its claims brought beyond its amount, less its tip and
every earlier refund of goods. When there is such extra money, the refund
dialog prefills it, capped at what is left, as it is what the business did
not charge for. The payment detail, the payment history and the bill's
payment rows measure the refund state against the same limit.

## Alternatives considered

Keeping the limit at the payment amount, or the cash received, as before
refund/0003. Money a payment received above it could not be returned through
Payky, and its extra money sale could never be reversed.

## Consequences

Returning only a duplicate shows the payment partly refunded while its real
sale stands. Returning the goods and the tip leaves nothing reported in EET,
apart from the known gaps `docs/eet.md` lists. The prefill does not subtract
extra money already returned, so it offers it again, capped at what is left.
