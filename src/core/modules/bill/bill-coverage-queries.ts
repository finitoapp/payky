 * dedupes by transaction id and sums per payment (minus tip, once per
 * payment). Unlike `claimedPaymentsByBillIdQuery`, this carries the real
 * transaction `amount` rather than the payment's nominal one, so it stays
 * correct when a payment ends up claimed for more (or, mid-split, less)
 * than its own amount — see `calculatePaymentClaimedSum`'s doc comment in
 * `payment-status-utils.ts`.
 *
 * `accountTransaction.amount` is in the transaction's own currency, which
 * for a Lightning/Spark settlement is satoshis against a fiat payment, so
 * the payment's `amount`/`currency` and its `paymentBtc.amountSats` come
 * along as the rate `calculateClaimedSum` converts with. See
 * docs/bill-payment-states.md.
