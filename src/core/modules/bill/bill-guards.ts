 * split and 3000 across two bills after it, reported as success.
 *

 * pass the same line twice (two partial quantities of one line), and taking
 * only the last entry would both wave through an over-selection and misjudge
 * the emptiness check in `cancelSourceBillIfEmptied`.
 *
 * Deliberately an error rather than a clamp. Each selected line carries its

 * it — a net summary does not expose a unit price for manual amounts — so
 * "move as much as is there" cannot be answered exactly. Refusing leaves the
